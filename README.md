# The Quest for the Crystal Kingdom
## Overview

"The Quest for the Crystal Kingdom" is an adventure-driven text-based project that showcases implementations of advanced algorithms to solve problems within a virtual world. The game challenges the player to navigate through a forest, discovering the shortest paths, building minimum spanning trees, and managing inventories with efficient data structures.

This project is a blend of computer science concepts and interactive gameplay, highlighting practical applications of Floyd's algorithm, Prim's algorithm, and AVL trees, among others.

## Features

1. **Shortest Path Calculation (Floyd's Algorithm):**
   - The program calculates the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a graph.
   - Considers edge weights (e.g., 1, 100, infinity) to represent different types of connections.

2. **Minimum Spanning Tree (Prim's Algorithm):**
   - Constructs a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) for the graph.
   - Optimizes resource usage by finding the minimum total edge weight connecting all vertices.

3. **Efficient Data Storage (AVL Tree):**
   - Uses AVL trees for dynamically maintaining a balanced inventory of items collected during the game.

4. **Interactive Input:**
   - Input the number of vertices and corresponding adjacency matrices to analyze the graph.
   - Choose edge weights and graph structures dynamically during runtime.

5. **Output Details:**
   - Provides detailed output for shortest paths, adjacency matrices, and MST weights.
